LODCOMPR is a batch program that does side-by-side listings of 2 or 3
load module libraries (either PDSes or PDSEs), showing member names,
sizes, and linkedit/bind dates, flagging the ones that don't match.
(It can also be run specifing only 1 library, which produces a straight
member list of that library.)

Since it's comparing only the directory information and module sizes,
not the actual data, it isn't as foolproof as ISPF compare, but it's a
good way to check the differences between two or three loadlibs.
TSO tools like STARTOOL, PDS86, File-Aid MVS, and File Manager give
the same information (and I assume can do so in batch), but I'm not
aware of any that compare multiple loadlibs.

LODCOMPR is in COBOL, but most of the work is done in an Assembler
subprogram named LODCMPIO.

Execution JCL:
//stepname EXEC PGM=LODCOMPR,PARM='FILES=n,LIST=value'
      FILES is required and must be either 1, 2, or 3.
      LIST=ALL:  All members of all files are listed.  Exceptions
         (members that don't match in size/EPA/date/alias, or that are
         not present in all files) are asterisked.
      LIST=EXCEPTIONS:  Only exceptions are listed; members present in
         all files with identical size/EPA/date/alias are omitted.
      LIST=DUPS:  All members present in more than one file are listed
         (regardless of whether their size/EPA/date/alias match).
         Members present in exactly one file are omitted.
      If LIST is not coded, LIST=EXCEPTIONS is default.
      If FILES=1, LIST=ALL is forced.
//INPUT1 DD DSN=...,DISP=SHR
//INPUT2 DD DSN=...,DISP=SHR   (may be omitted if FILES=1)
//INPUT3 DD DSN=...,DISP=SHR   (may be omitted if FILES=1 or 2)
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=class,DCB=RECFM=FA
